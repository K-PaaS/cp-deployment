# iproute2 is required for networking related facts gathering

# Note: It is not recommended way, but since the tasks execution order, put it here is the simplest way so far. We can move it to a proper place later.
# TODO: move this to roles/kubernetes/preinstall/vars/main.yml -> pkgs variables
# Currently not possible because the collect the network facts before that step, needs reordering of the exec flow.
